    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:  \n",
    "__Gaussian Naive Bayes__\n",
    "- It can easily be applied for application where number of features are very large.It can be applied to industries like spam classifier and essentially in any industrial application where text processing is involved.i.e spam classifier,Email Classifying system.\n",
    "- Its strength is that it is faster to prototype and can handle large features easily.\n",
    "- This algorithm assumes that the feature we are analyzing are independent which is why it is called naive bayes.However it is not true in all cases.It gives pretty low accuracy in certain cases where features are dependent.\n",
    "- Our given data contains a lot of disorderness and distribution intially wasnot normal so we will use Gaussian Naive Bayes which will be able to fit our data well. \n",
    "- Our data has certain random probabilistic nature alongside certain independencies from each other which fits well for our Naive assumption it must perform better at this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Decision Tree__\n",
    "- It can easily be applied to algorithm where we data is categorical.Essentially it can be applied to any application where multiple choices are involved i.e Recommender systems.\n",
    "- It is popular for its tendency to being faster prototype to even great size of data.\n",
    "- Alot of times this algorithm tends to overfit data.\n",
    "- This model is great choice because of the fact that a lot of features a involved so quick application and prototyping.\n",
    "- Furthermore in somesense our data has quiet catergorical nature so decision tree would certainly do well in our case.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ensemble method__\n",
    "- It can be applied to almost anywhere as it essentially combines our algorithms and retuns an algorithm of our choise.Essentially,it got great roles in prototyping BCI(brain computer interface) application.\n",
    "- This model is popular for being able to fit well and leave some space for test set errors.\n",
    "- Depending upon selection of parameters it can lead to great errors if samples are similar.\n",
    "- This algorithm will be able to classify our dataset with much better bias and variance and will eventually lead to a much better accuracy.\n",
    "- Given our data has certain feature so this method will divide our data into a lot of weak learners that will learn and will practice and eventually will become better at a lot of feature given that some are categorical data so our weak group will be performing good on categorical values and other will be performing good on continous values."

    "Final model that was chosen for this process is AdaBoost Classifier of Ensemble methods.\n",
    "Reason for that as shown from statistics are following, \n",
    "- this model was trained with help of algorithm called AdaBoost which works in following manner.Simply,it divides problem into certain little problems called weak learners.A weak learner is any machine learning algorithm that gives better accuracy than simply guessing. For instance, if you are trying to classify animals at a zoo, you might have an algorithm that can correctly identify zebras most of the time, but it simply guesses for any other animal. That algorithm would be a weak learner because it is better than guessing.If you had an algorithm that identified every animal as a zebra, then that probably is not better than guessing and so it would not be a weak learner.\n",
    "- For boosting problems, the best kinds of weak learners are ones that are very accurate, even if it is only over a limited scope of the problem. For instance the algorithm that correctly identifies zebras would be good. It allows you to confidently identify as least most of the zebras, allowing other weak learners to focus on the remaining animals.\n",
    "- Boosting algorithms typically work by solving subsections of the problem, by peeling them away so future boosting iterations can solve the remaining sections.\n",
    "- weak learners are best combined in a way that allows each one to solve a limited section of the problem. Any machine learning routine can be used as a weak learner. Neural nets, support vector machines or any other would work, but the most commonly used weak learner is the decision tree\n",
    "- this model has both good accuracy and f1 score which simply means that this algorithm will not only perform well on current situation but have generalized so well that it can potentially generalize to most of different data.\n",
    "- this model simply takes data from user and under the hood inside the black box it performs certain techniques and feed this preprocessed data to a algorithm that perform certain mathematical operations and eventually yeilds output wether our target user have income greater them 50000 for which it yeilds value 1 or Positive.If not then it yeilds a 0 value or Negative."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
