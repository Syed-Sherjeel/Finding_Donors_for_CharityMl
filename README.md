# Finding_donors
Major purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning algorithm for a ficticious charity organization.We will develop a model that will allow company to predict wether a certain user have income greater then 50K USD or less.If a person have income greater then 50K Usd this means that person possibly can have enough money to donate to our organization.
# Getting started
First we will download required dependencies to get started with this project
```
pip install numpy
pip install sklearn
pip install matplotlib
```

Now your setup is ready for running this project.
# Usage Example
Our main code in written in a well documented notebook that explains everything perform data acquistion to data preprocessing and eventually data modelling with various contraints.
However here are some usage examples,
```
bestclf.predict(X_train)
```
where X_train is a set of features on which our data will make predictions in following order.   
   
# Outcome
An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than $50,000.
